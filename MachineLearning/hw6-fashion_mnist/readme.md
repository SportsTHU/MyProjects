The experiment to classify using a convolutional neural network:
The basic idea is: first, we read in the data as a feature vector. Then, after 2 convolutional layers, and 2 linear transformation. We find the output. And then the back propagation process: we find the difference between the expected and the actual output. And update the parameters from the output port to the input port.
